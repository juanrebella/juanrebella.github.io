            I am an IT Specialist with more than 7 years of experience working from Helpdesk to System administration in fast-paced companies such as Alorica. 
			Proficient abilities to set up hardware and strong communication skills to explain issues and solutions to non-technical customers.
			Always pursuing continuous education in the infotech field, ranging from automation programming to the latest software architecture solutions. 
			In my previous experiences, I was able to work under the ITIL methodology, broadly used in modern organizations nowadays.

           I love learning new things.
           While solving real customer problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to technical problems.
           I'm looking for a individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
